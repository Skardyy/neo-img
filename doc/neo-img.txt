# Neo-Img  
A Neovim plugin for viewing images in the terminal. 

---

## Features ✨  
- Automatically preview supported image files
- Oil.nvim preview support
- Caching

## Installation 🚀  

> uses [ttyimg](https://github.com/Skardyy/ttyimg)  
> you can install it in 2 ways:  
> * via `:NeoImg Install` **(recommended)**
> * globally via `go install github.com/Skardyy/ttyimg@v1.0.5`, make sure you have GOPATH in your path `export PATH="$HOME/go/bin:$PATH`

Using lazy.nvim:
```lua
return {
    'skardyy/neo-img',
    build = ":NeoImg Install",
    config = function()
        require('neo-img').setup()
    end
}
```

## Usage 💼  
- Images will automatically preview when opening supported files  
- Use `:NeoImg DisplayImage` to manually display the current file  
- you can also call `require("neo-img.utils").display_image(filepath, win)` to display the image in the given window  

## Configuration ⚙️  
> document files require Libreoffice  
>  ```txt
>    make sure its installed and in your path  
>    * window: its called soffice and should be in C:\Program Files\LibreOffice\program 
>    * linux: should be in the path automatically
>  ```

```lua
require('neo-img').setup({
  supported_extensions = {
    png = true,
    jpg = true,
    jpeg = true,
    tiff = true,
    tif = true,
    svg = true,
    webp = true,
    bmp = true,
    gif = true, -- static only
    docx = true,
    xlsx = true,
    pdf = true,
    pptx = true,
    odg = true,
    odp = true,
    ods = true,
    odt = true
  },

  ----- Important ones -----
  size = "80%",  -- size of the image in percent
  center = true, -- rather or not to center the image in the window
  ----- Important ones -----

  ----- Less Important -----
  auto_open = true,   -- Automatically open images when buffer is loaded
  oil_preview = true, -- changes oil preview of images too
  backend = "auto",   -- auto / kitty / iterm / sixel
  resizeMode = "Fit", -- Fit / Strech / Crop
  offset = "2x3",     -- that exmp is 2 cells offset x and 3 y.
  ttyimg = "local"    -- local / global
  ----- Less Important -----
})
```  

* supported_extensions: the extension of file to replace with an image.
* size: size of the image compared to the window in percent, must be percent!
* center: centers the image in x axis inside the window.
* auto_open: auto replaces buffers with images. replaces calling :NeoImg DisplayImage every time. only relevant for buffers and not oil!
* oil_preview: replaces oil preview of supported extensions into images. don't use outdated oil version :(
* backend: enforces a graphic protocol if the auto fails to match.
* resizeMode: the resize mode to apply on the size.
* offset: offset from the window top left. works in addition to the center option!
* ttyimg: enforces different installation of ttyimg. global is from go, local is from :NeoImg Install. some PCs may not have supported precompiled binary from ttyimg, so the global installation can solve that.
